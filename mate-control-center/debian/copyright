  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public

free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some

other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for
your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
